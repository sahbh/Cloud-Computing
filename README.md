# Cloud-Computing
As part of the Cloud Computing module during my Master’s at Queen Mary University of London, I developed a lightweight Flask-based REST API and deployed it within a simulated cloud environment. The project focused on key infrastructure concepts including containerisation, load balancing, and firewall configuration.

I explored modern architectural approaches such as microservices, service discovery, DNS routing through CDNs, and communication models like REST and RPC. Security considerations were also a major component, including the use of asymmetric encryption and password hashing. I evaluated different virtualisation techniques (emulation, paravirtualisation, and hardware-assisted virtualisation) and scaling strategies (vertical vs horizontal), applying them within the context of cloud-native application design.

This project demonstrated my ability to design, build, and manage scalable cloud applications — and was awarded top marks.
